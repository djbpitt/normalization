Notes

Should normalization be based on choices within the ms, e.g., o-stem ~ u-stem? How about bě ~ běaše? If so, how should
distinctions not recorded in PROIEL (historical stem type, aspect) be managed?

Normalization favors the archaic, even when it contradicts more common younger spellings in the manuscripts. For example,
gospodь is declined as an i-stem, even though o-stem and jo-stem forms are common.

As an exception to the preceding, the new sigmatic aorist is used instead of root or old (unexpanded) sigmatic forms.
Thus 3pl ведошѧ instead of ведѫ (root) or весѧ (old sigmatic). 

Palatal sonants (r, l, n) always have a palatalization hook, not only in potentially ambiguous situations (e.g., "ri" could
be plain or palatal), but also in unambiguous ones (e.g., "r" before a jotated vowel letter, which must be palatal).

PROIEL tags all abbreviated numerals as cardinal and non-inflecting. We change them to cardinal or ordinal according to use.
PROIEL also tags третии as an adjective; we change it to an ordinal numeral.
